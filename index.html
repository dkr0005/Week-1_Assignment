      Here, %PUBLIC_URL% works as a placeholder for the public folder path. 
      During the build process, it automatically replaces this placeholder 
      with the actual path to the public folder. This ensures compatibility 
      with client-side routing and non-root URLs.

      Let me explain what this HTML file does:
      - This file acts as a template for the React app.
      - If you open it directly in a browser, you will see an empty page because 
        React components are responsible for rendering the content dynamically.
      - You can add resources like fonts, meta tags, or analytics here, if needed.

      Development and Build:
      - To start the development server, I run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      - When I want to build the app for production, I use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
      - The build step injects the compiled scripts into this file, specifically inside the <body> tag.
